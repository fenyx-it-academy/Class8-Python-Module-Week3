## Assignment 1

Write a Python function that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
Note : Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal.

Sample Pascal's triangle :

Pascal's triangle
Each number is the two numbers above it added together

## Assignment 2

Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white
Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow

## Assignment 3

Write a Python function to check whether a number is perfect or not.

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number) : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).

Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.

## Assignment 4

Create a user interface that generates a random password with the given user input such as length, number of lowercase letters and uppercase letters and adding special characters(!,?, .,etc.)

## Bonus

### Bonus 1

Write a Python program to sort a list of dictionaries using Lambda.
Original list of dictionaries :
[{'make': 'Nokia', 'model': 216, 'color': 'Black'}, {'make': 'Mi Max', 'model': '2', 'color': 'Gold'}, {'make': 'Samsung', 'model': 7, 'color': 'Blue'}]

Sorting the List of dictionaries :
[{'make': 'Nokia', 'model': 216, 'color': 'Black'}, {'make': 'Samsung', 'model': 7, 'color': 'Blue'}, {'make': 'Mi Max', 'model': '2', 'color': 'Gold'}]

### Bonus 2

Write a Python program to filter a list of integers using Lambda.

Original list of integers:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Even numbers from the said list:
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

Odd numbers from the said list:
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
